/**
 * @file scancode_config.h
 * @brief Compile-Time Configuration for XT Protocol
 * 
 * This header provides compile-time scancode configuration for XT protocol.
 * XT keyboards always use Scancode Set 1, so this header simply provides
 * a convenience wrapper that hardcodes Set 1 configuration.
 * 
 * Usage (XT Protocol Only):
 * -------------------------
 * ```c
 * #include "scancode_config.h"
 * 
 * void keyboard_interface_task(void) {
 *     uint8_t code;
 *     if (get_scancode_from_buffer(&code)) {
 *         process_scancode_ct(code);  // Compile-time Set 1
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * ---------
 * ✅ Zero runtime overhead (Set 1 hardcoded)
 * ✅ No CMake configuration needed
 * ✅ Self-contained header
 * ✅ Simple and explicit
 * 
 * @note For AT/PS2 protocol, use scancode_runtime.h instead (supports Set 2/3 detection)
 * @see scancode.h for the unified processor API
 * @see scancode_runtime.h for AT/PS2 runtime detection
 */
