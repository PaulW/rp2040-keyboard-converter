 * @brief Apple M0110 Keyboard Protocol Implementation
 * 
 * This file implements the Apple M0110 keyboard protocol used by early Macintosh computers.
 * The protocol is a synchronous, bidirectional communication system where the keyboard
 * controls the clock signal and the host (Mac) sends commands to request key data.
 * 
 * Protocol Characteristics:
 * - 2-wire interface: DATA and CLOCK (both open-drain with pull-ups)
 * - Keyboard controls clock timing
 * - MSB-first bit transmission
 * - No parity or stop bits
 * - Keyboard-initiated transmission for key events
 * - Host-initiated transmission for commands
 * 
 * Timing Requirements:
 * - KEYBOARD→HOST: 330µs cycles (160µs low, 170µs high) ≈ 3.03kHz
 * - HOST→KEYBOARD: 400µs cycles (180µs low, 220µs high) ≈ 2.5kHz
 * - Request-to-send: 840µs DATA low period
 * - Data hold time: 80µs after final clock edge
 * 
 * Initialization Sequence:
 * 1. Host sends Model Number command (0x16)
 * 2. Keyboard responds with model ID and resets itself
 * 3. Host begins normal operation with Inquiry commands
 * 4. Inquiry commands sent every 250ms during normal operation
 * 
 * Supported Models:
 * - M0110: Original compact keyboard (1984)
 * - M0110A: Enhanced version with arrow keys and numeric keypad (1987)
