 * @brief Apple M0110 Keyboard Protocol Implementation
 * 
 * This implementation handles the Apple M0110 keyboard protocol used by early Macintosh
 * computers (1984-1987). The protocol features:
 * 
 * Physical Interface:
 * - 2-wire synchronous serial communication (DATA + CLOCK)
 * - Open-drain signals with pull-up resistors
 * - Keyboard controls clock timing
 * - 5V TTL logic levels
 * 
 * Communication Protocol:
 * - MSB-first bit transmission (bit 7 → bit 0)
 * - No start, parity, or stop bits
 * - 8-bit command/response format
 * - Keyboard-controlled clock for both TX and RX
 * 
 * Timing Characteristics:
 * - Keyboard TX: ~3.03kHz (330µs cycles: 160µs low, 170µs high)
 * - Host TX: ~2.5kHz (400µs cycles: 180µs low, 220µs high)
 * - Request-to-Send: 840µs DATA low pulse
 * - Data hold: 80µs minimum after final clock edge
 * 
 * State Machine:
 * 1. UNINITIALISED → Wait for startup delay (1000ms)
 * 2. INIT_MODEL_REQUEST → Send model command, wait for response (500ms retry intervals)
 * 3. INITIALISED → Normal operation with response timeout monitoring (500ms)
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Timeout detection (500ms max response time)
 * - Timer wraparound protection for robust timeout calculations
 * - Automatic retry with maximum attempt limits
 * - State machine reset on communication failure
 * - PIO FIFO overflow protection

/**
 * @brief Main task function for Apple M0110 keyboard protocol management
 * 
 * This function implements the main state machine for M0110 protocol operation.
 * It should be called regularly from the main application loop (typically every few ms).
 * 
 * State Machine Operation:
 * 
 * 1. UNINITIALISED (Startup Phase):
 *    - Waits for initial 1000ms delay to allow keyboard power-up
 *    - Uses command timing to track startup delay
 *    - Transitions to model identification phase when delay expires
 * 
 * 2. INIT_MODEL_REQUEST (Keyboard Detection):
 *    - Sends Model Number commands (0x16) every 500ms using command timing
 *    - Retries up to 5 times if no response received
 *    - Model command causes keyboard to reset and identify itself
 *    - Transitions to INITIALISED phase on successful response (handled by IRQ)
 * 
 * 3. INITIALISED (Normal Operation):
 *    - Monitors keyboard responses using response timing for 500ms timeout
 *    - Processes buffered key data when USB HID interface ready
 *    - Timeout detection triggers return to UNINITIALISED for recovery
 *    - Key data processing occurs via ring buffer from interrupt handler
 * 
 * Timing and Performance:
 * - Optimized timing calculations with single elapsed time computation
 * - Timer wraparound protection prevents false timeouts on system rollover
 * 
 * Error Recovery:
 * - Timeout detection triggers full protocol restart
 * - State machine reset returns to UNINITIALISED phase
 * - Maximum retry limits prevent infinite retry loops
 * 
 * @note This function manages protocol timing and state transitions
 * @note Actual data reception occurs in interrupt context
 * @note Timer calculations are optimized to handle uint32_t wraparound scenarios

/**
 * @brief Initializes the Apple M0110 keyboard interface hardware and software
 * 
 * This function configures the RP2040 PIO system to handle the Apple M0110 protocol:
 * 
 * Hardware Configuration:
 * - Allocates and configures PIO state machine for M0110 timing
 * - Sets up GPIO pins with appropriate pull-ups for open-drain signaling
 * - Configures interrupt handling for received data
 * 
 * Protocol Setup:
 * - Calculates timing dividers for accurate bit-level timing
 * - Initializes PIO program for MSB-first transmission/reception
 * - Sets up FIFO buffers for asynchronous data handling
 * 
 * Pin Assignment:
 * - data_pin: Connected to keyboard DATA line
 * - data_pin + 1: Connected to keyboard CLOCK line (keyboard controlled)
 * 
 * Timing Calculation:
 * - Base timing uses 160µs as minimum reliable detection period
 * - PIO clock divider ensures proper sampling of keyboard signals
 * - Supports both keyboard TX (330µs cycles) and host TX (400µs cycles)
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Validates PIO resource availability
 * - Graceful degradation if hardware resources unavailable
 * - Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
 * 
 * @param data_pin GPIO pin number for DATA line (CLOCK will be data_pin + 1)
 *                 Must be even number to allow consecutive pin allocation
 *                 Recommended: Use pins with good signal integrity (avoid LED pins)
 * 
 * @note Call this function once during system initialization
 * @note Requires keyboard_interface_task() to be called regularly for operation
 * @see keyboard_interface_task() for ongoing protocol management
