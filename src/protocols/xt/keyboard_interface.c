/**
 * @file keyboard_interface.c
 * @brief IBM XT Keyboard Protocol Implementation
 * 
 * This implementation handles the IBM XT keyboard protocol used by the original
 * IBM PC and PC/XT systems. This is the simplest keyboard protocol featuring:
 * 
 * Physical Interface:
 * - Single-wire DATA connection (no separate clock)
 * - Keyboard self-clocks on the DATA line
 * - 5V TTL logic levels with pull-up resistor
 * - 5-pin DIN connector (original IBM design)
 * 
 * Communication Protocol:
 * - Unidirectional: Keyboard → Host only
 * - LSB-first bit transmission (bit 0 → bit 7)
 * - No start, stop, or parity bits
 * - Fixed 8-bit scan code format
 * - No host commands or bidirectional communication
 * 
 * Timing Characteristics:
 * - Keyboard-controlled timing: ~10 kHz bit rate
 * - Clock pulse: ~40µs low, ~60µs high (~100µs total)
 * - PIO sampling: 10µs interval for double-start-bit detection
 * - IBM XT sends two start bits, clones send one (differentiation required)
 * - No host flow control or inhibit capability
 * - Immediate transmission when keys pressed/released
 * 
 * Scan Code Format:
 * - Make codes: 0x01-0x53 (key press events)
 * - Break codes: Make code + 0x80 (key release events) 
 * - Single-byte codes only (no multi-byte sequences)
 * - Fixed scan code set (equivalent to later "Set 1")
 * 
 * State Machine:
 * - UNINITIALISED: System startup, waiting for first scan code
 * - INITIALISED: Normal operation, processing scan codes
 * 
 * Advantages:
 * - Simple, reliable protocol with minimal overhead
 * - No initialization sequence required
 * - Immediate operation on power-up
 * - Compatible with basic keyboard functionality
 * 
 * Limitations:
 * - No LED control capability
 * - No typematic rate control
 * - No host-to-keyboard communication
 * - Limited to basic scan code set
 * - No keyboard identification or capabilities detection

/**
 * @brief IBM XT Keyboard Scan Code Processor
 * 
 * Processes scan codes received from IBM XT keyboards using the simple unidirectional
 * protocol. XT keyboards begin transmitting immediately upon power-up with no complex
 * initialization sequence required:
 * 
 * Protocol Characteristics:
 * - Unidirectional communication (keyboard to host only)
 * - Single-byte scan codes transmitted immediately
 * - LSB-first bit transmission format
 * - No acknowledgment or flow control required
 * - Fixed scan code set (equivalent to later "Set 1")
 * 
 * Scan Code Format:
 * - Make codes: 0x01-0x53 (key press events)
 * - Break codes: Make code + 0x80 (key release events, e.g., 0x81 = key 0x01 released)
 * - Self-test pass: 0xAA (transmitted once on successful power-on)
 * - Self-test fail: Other values (indicates keyboard malfunction)
 * 
 * State Machine Operation:
 * - UNINITIALISED: Waiting for first valid data (typically 0xAA self-test result)
 * - INITIALISED: Normal operation, processing all scan codes
 * - Simple 2-state machine reflects protocol simplicity
 * 
 * Data Processing:
 * - First byte expected to be 0xAA (self-test passed)
 * - Failed self-test triggers state machine reset and PIO restart
 * - Valid scan codes queued to ring buffer for HID processing
 * - No protocol-level error recovery needed
 * 
 * Performance Features:
 * - Minimal interrupt processing overhead
 * - Direct scan code queuing to ring buffer
 * - No complex state tracking or timeout handling
 * - Ring buffer overflow protection
 * 
 * Compatibility:
 * - Compatible with IBM PC/XT keyboards (1981-1987)
 * - Supports clone keyboards following XT protocol
 * - Works with modern XT-compatible keyboards
 * - No special handling for keyboard variants needed
 * 
 * @param data_byte 8-bit scan code received from keyboard (LSB-first transmission)
 * 
 * @note Executes in interrupt context - processing kept minimal for real-time performance
 * @note XT protocol simplicity eliminates need for complex error handling
 * @note Self-test validation ensures keyboard is functional before accepting scan codes

/**
 * @brief IBM XT Keyboard IRQ Event Handler
 * 
 * Interrupt service routine that processes raw scan code data received from IBM XT
 * keyboards via the PIO state machine. Implements the simple XT protocol with minimal
 * overhead and maximum reliability:
 * 
 * Frame Processing:
 * - Reads 9-bit frame from PIO RX FIFO (Start bit + 8 data bits)
 * - Extracts start bit and reconstructs 8-bit scan code
 * - No parity or stop bits in XT protocol (simplified format)
 * - Direct bit manipulation for optimal interrupt performance
 * 
 * Protocol Validation:
 * - Start bit validation: Must be 1 (mark condition for XT protocol)
 * - Invalid start bit triggers state machine reset and PIO restart
 * - Simple validation reflects XT protocol simplicity
 * - Minimal error checking reduces interrupt processing time
 * 
 * Keyboard Compatibility:
 * - Handles both genuine IBM and clone XT keyboards
 * - PIO code automatically filters double start bits (clone keyboard artifact)
 * - Transparent handling of timing variations between keyboard types
 * - No special detection or configuration needed for different variants
 * 
 * Data Flow:
 * - Valid frames passed directly to keyboard event processor
 * - Invalid frames trigger protocol restart for clean recovery
 * - Scan codes processed in interrupt context for minimal latency
 * - Ring buffer queuing handled at event processor level
 * 
 * Reset Handling:
 * - XT keyboards have no software reset command capability
 * - Reset achieved by restarting PIO state machine
 * - PIO initialization triggers hardware-level keyboard reset
 * - Automatic recovery from communication errors
 * 
 * Performance Optimization:
 * - Minimal interrupt processing time (< 10µs typical)
 * - Direct FIFO access without buffering overhead  
 * - Efficient bit extraction using shift operations
 * - No complex state tracking in interrupt context
 * 
 * Hardware Integration:
 * - Single DATA line monitoring (no separate clock)
 * - Keyboard self-clocks data transmission
 * - No host timing control or flow management needed
 * - PIO handles all signal timing automatically
 * 
 * @note ISR function - must complete quickly to maintain real-time performance
 * @note PIO state machine handles complex timing requirements transparently  
 * @note Start bit filtering for clone keyboards handled in PIO code, not here
 * @note No software reset capability - reset via PIO restart only

 * - Installs XT keyboard input event handler for scan code processing
 * - Enables interrupt-driven reception for optimal performance
 * - Links PIO RX FIFO to interrupt processing system
 * 
 * Software Initialization:
 * - Resets ring buffer to ensure clean startup state
 * - Initializes protocol state machine to UNINITIALISED
 * - Resets converter status LEDs when CONVERTER_LEDS enabled
 * - Clears all protocol state variables
 * 
 * Timing Configuration:
 * - Based on IBM PC/XT Technical Reference specifications

 * - Accommodates keyboard clock variations (~40µs low, ~60µs high)
 * - Supports original IBM and compatible clone keyboards
 *

 * - Compatible with modern XT-protocol keyboards
 * - Handles timing variations in clone keyboards
 * - No keyboard-specific configuration needed
 *

 * 
 * @param data_pin GPIO pin number for single DATA line (XT single-wire interface)
 * 
 * @note XT protocol uses single DATA line - no separate CLOCK pin needed
 * @note Function blocks until hardware initialization complete  
 * @note Much simpler setup than AT/PS2 due to XT protocol design
