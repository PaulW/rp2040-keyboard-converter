 * @brief IBM XT Keyboard Protocol Implementation
 * 
 * This file implements the IBM XT keyboard protocol used by the original IBM PC/XT
 * systems (1981-1987). This is the simplest of the IBM keyboard protocols.
 * 
 * Protocol Characteristics:
 * - 1-wire interface: DATA only (no separate clock line)
 * - Keyboard generates its own clock signal on DATA line
 * - Unidirectional communication (keyboard to host only)
 * - LSB-first bit transmission (bit 0 → bit 7)
 * - No parity, start, or stop bits
 * - Fixed scan code set (Set 1 equivalent)
 * - No host commands or acknowledgments
 * 
 * Physical Interface:
 * - Single DATA line with pull-up resistor
 * - Keyboard pulls line low/high to generate clock and data
 * - 5V TTL logic levels
 * - 5-pin DIN connector on original IBM keyboards
 * 
 * Timing Requirements:
 * - Keyboard-generated clock: approximately 10 kHz
 * - Clock pulse width: ~40µs low, 60µs high
 * - Total bit time: ~100µs
 * - No host timing control or flow control
 * 
 * Data Format:
 * - 8 bits per scan code, LSB first
 * - Make codes: 0x01-0x53 (key press)
 * - Break codes: Make code + 0x80 (key release)
 * - No multi-byte sequences or special commands
 * 
 * Initialization:
 * - No initialization sequence required
 * - Keyboard begins transmitting immediately when powered
 * - Host simply receives and processes scan codes
 * 
 * Compatibility:
 * - Compatible with IBM PC (1981), PC/XT (1983)
 * - Subset of AT keyboard functionality
 * - Simple, reliable protocol with minimal overhead
