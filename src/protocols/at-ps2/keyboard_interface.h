 * @brief AT/PS2 Keyboard Protocol Implementation
 * 
 * This file implements the AT and PS/2 keyboard protocols used by IBM PC compatible systems.
 * The protocol is a synchronous, bidirectional communication system where the host can send
 * commands and the keyboard responds with data and acknowledgments.
 * 
 * Protocol Characteristics:
 * - 2-wire interface: DATA and CLOCK (both open-drain with pull-ups)
 * - Keyboard normally controls clock timing
 * - Host can inhibit communication by pulling CLOCK low
 * - LSB-first bit transmission (bit 0 → bit 7)
 * - Start bit (0), 8 data bits, odd parity bit, stop bit (1)
 * - Bidirectional communication with acknowledgments
 * 
 * Supported Scan Code Sets:
 * - Set 1: Original XT scan codes (default for AT keyboards)
 * - Set 2: Standard PS/2 scan codes (default for PS/2 keyboards)
 * - Set 3: Terminal keyboard scan codes (less common)
 * 
 * Timing Requirements:
 * - Clock frequency: 10-16.7 kHz
 * - Clock pulse width: minimum 30µs
 * - Data setup/hold: minimum 5µs before/after clock edge
 * - Inhibit time: minimum 100µs CLOCK low to stop transmission
 * 
 * Initialization Sequence:
 * 1. Power-on self-test (keyboard sends 0xAA on success)
 * 2. Host reads keyboard ID (2-byte response)
 * 3. Host configures scan code set and options
 * 4. Host sets LED states
 * 5. Normal operation begins
 * 
 * Special Features:
 * - LED control (Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock)
 * - Typematic rate and delay configuration
 * - Multiple scan code set support
 * - Keyboard identification and capability detection
 * - Compatible with both AT and PS/2 electrical interfaces
