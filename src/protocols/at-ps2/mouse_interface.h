 * @brief AT/PS2 Mouse Protocol Implementation
 * 
 * This file implements the AT and PS/2 mouse protocols used by IBM PC compatible systems.
 * The mouse protocol shares the same physical interface as keyboards but uses different
 * command sets and data packet formats for position and button reporting.
 * 
 * Protocol Characteristics:
 * - 2-wire interface: DATA and CLOCK (shared with keyboard, same electrical specs)
 * - Mouse normally controls clock timing during data transmission
 * - Host can inhibit communication by pulling CLOCK low
 * - LSB-first bit transmission (bit 0 → bit 7)
 * - Start bit (0), 8 data bits, odd parity bit, stop bit (1)
 * - Bidirectional communication with command acknowledgments
 * 
 * Supported Mouse Types:
 * - Standard PS/2 Mouse (3-byte packets): Position + 3 buttons
 * - IntelliMouse (4-byte packets): Position + 3 buttons + scroll wheel
 * - IntelliMouse Explorer (4-byte packets): Position + 5 buttons + scroll wheel
 * 
 * Data Packet Formats:
 * - Standard: [Status Byte] [X Movement] [Y Movement]
 * - Extended: [Status Byte] [X Movement] [Y Movement] [Z Movement/Extra Buttons]
 * 
 * Timing Requirements:
 * - Same as keyboard: 10-16.7 kHz clock, minimum 30µs pulse width
 * - Data setup/hold: minimum 5µs before/after clock edge
 * - Inhibit time: minimum 100µs CLOCK low to stop transmission
 * 
 * Initialization Sequence:
 * 1. Power-on self-test (mouse sends 0xAA on success, 0x00 as device ID)
 * 2. Mouse type detection via sample rate sequence (200-100-80 or 200-200-80)
 * 3. Configuration: resolution, scaling, sample rate, enable data reporting
 * 4. Continuous data streaming of movement/button packets
 * 
 * Special Features:
 * - Multiple resolution settings (1-8 counts/mm)
 * - Adjustable sample rate (10-200 reports/second)
 * - 1:1 or 2:1 scaling modes
 * - Stream mode (continuous) or remote mode (on-request) reporting
