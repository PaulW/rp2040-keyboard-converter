 * @brief Sends a HID report with automatic logging.
 * 
 * This wrapper function logs the report contents when DEBUG enabled or on failure.
 * Using this function ensures all HID reports are consistently logged without
 * performance overhead (single function call vs separate log + send).
 * 
 * The function builds a formatted hex dump of the report (matching USB wire format
 * with Report ID first) only when needed:
 * - Always when DEBUG logging enabled (log level >= LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG)
 * - Always when transmission fails (for error diagnostics)
 * - Never otherwise (zero overhead in production with DEBUG disabled)
 * 
 * This optimized approach constructs the hex dump only once, even if both
 * DEBUG is enabled AND transmission fails. The appropriate log level (DEBUG
 * or ERROR) is chosen based on the final transmission result.
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - LOG_LEVEL < DEBUG + success: Only TinyUSB send (~1.6µs, near-zero overhead)
 * - LOG_LEVEL >= DEBUG + success: TinyUSB send + hex dump + UART (~16µs)
 * - Any level + failure: TinyUSB send attempt + hex dump + UART (~16µs)
 * - Inline function allows compiler to optimize based on call site
 * - Single hex dump construction (not duplicated if DEBUG enabled AND failure)
 * 
 * Memory Overhead:
 * - Zero heap allocation (stack-only buffer)
 * - 128-byte stack buffer only allocated when logging needed
 * - Buffer immediately freed when function returns
 * 
 * @param instance    The HID interface instance number
 * @param report_id   The HID report ID (automatically prepended by TinyUSB)

 * @return true if report was successfully queued for transmission, false on error

 * @note Failed transmissions are always logged regardless of log level
 * @note Hex dump only generated once (not duplicated on DEBUG+failure)

/**
 * @brief Adds a key to the HID keyboard report
 * 
 * This function adds a key to the current HID keyboard report structure.
 * The HID keyboard report maintains state for:
 * - 8 modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, GUI) in a bit field
 * - Up to 6 simultaneous regular key presses (6-key rollover)
 * 
 * Modifier Key Handling:
 * - Modifier keys (0xE0-0xE7) set bits in the modifier field
 * - Each modifier has its own bit position (Ctrl=0, Shift=1, Alt=2, GUI=3)
 * - Left and right variants use separate bits (e.g., Left Ctrl vs Right Ctrl)
 * 
 * Regular Key Handling:
 * - Regular keys stored in 6-element keycode array
 * - Function scans ALL slots for duplicates before adding (prevents double-entry bug)
 * - Remembers first available empty slot during scan
 * - Returns false if all 6 slots are full (keyboard rollover limit)
 * 
 * Duplicate Prevention:
 * - CRITICAL: Must check ALL slots before adding to any slot
 * - Previous implementation checked slot availability during duplicate scan,
 *   which could add a key to an early empty slot even if it existed later
 * - Bug scenario: Key A in slot 1, slot 0 empty, press A again → would add
 *   to slot 0, creating duplicate (A in both slot 0 and slot 1)
 * - Fix: Single loop that checks all slots for duplicates, remembers first empty slot,
 *   then adds to that slot only if key not already present
 * 
 * 6-Key Rollover Limitation:
 * - USB HID boot protocol supports maximum 6 simultaneous keys
 * - 7th key press will be ignored (function returns false)
 * - Could implement NKRO (N-key rollover) with custom report descriptor
 * 
 * @param key The HID keycode to add (modifier or regular key)
 * @return true if key was added, false if already present or buffer full
 * 
 * @note This function is called from main task context only
 * @note Modifier check uses IS_MOD() macro (checks range 0xE0-0xE7)
 * @note Fix for issue #19: Prevents duplicate keys in report array

 * - Clears the corresponding bit in the modifier field
 * - Uses bitwise AND with inverted mask to clear specific bit

 * - Sets matching entry to 0 (marks slot as empty)

/**
 * @brief Handles input reports for keyboard and consumer control devices
 * 
 * This is the main entry point for processing translated scan codes and sending
 * USB HID reports to the host. It handles three types of HID reports:
 * 
 * 1. Keyboard Reports (Standard Keys and Modifiers):
 * - Translates interface scan codes to HID keycodes via keymap lookup
 * - Updates keyboard report structure (modifiers + 6-key array)
 * - Only sends USB report if state changed (prevents duplicate reports)
 * - Handles typematic prevention (host handles key repeat, not device)
 * 
 * 2. Consumer Control Reports (Multimedia Keys):
 * - Media keys (play, pause, volume, etc.)
 * - Uses separate USB HID interface for consumer controls
 * - Single 16-bit usage code per report
 * - Code 0 indicates "no keys pressed" for key release
 * 
 * 3. Command Mode System:
 * - Time-based special function access for 2KRO keyboards
 * - Hold both shifts for 3 seconds to enter command mode
 * - LED provides visual feedback (Green/Blue alternating flash)
 * - Press 'B' for bootloader entry (other commands can be added)
 * - 3 second timeout or shift release exits command mode
 * - Keyboard reports suppressed during command mode operation
 * 
 * Command Mode vs. Legacy Macro System:
 * - Old: Action key + both shifts + 'B' (simultaneous press - fails on 2KRO)
 * - New: Hold both shifts 3s, then press 'B' (sequential - works on 2KRO)
 * - Legacy macro system (keymap_is_action_key_pressed) removed
 * - Command mode provides better UX with LED feedback
 * 
 * Report Deduplication:
 * - Uses report_modified flag to track actual state changes
 * - Some keyboards send typematic repeats (same key repeatedly)
 * - HID spec: host handles key repeat, device sends state changes only
 * - Prevents USB bus saturation from redundant reports
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Logs failed USB transmissions with report contents
 * - Continues operation on failure (transient USB issues)
 * - Could be enhanced with retry queue for critical reports
 * 
 * @param rawcode Interface scan code (protocol-normalized, not raw scan code)
 *                Example: 0x48 for Pause key across all protocols
 * @param make    true for key press, false for key release
 * 
 * @note Called from main task context via process_scancode()
 * @note Thread-safe: no interrupt access to keyboard_report or mouse_report
