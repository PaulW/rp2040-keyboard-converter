 *

 * The HID keyboard report maintains state for:
 * - 8 modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, GUI) in a bit field
 * - Up to 6 simultaneous regular key presses (6-key rollover)
 * 
 * Modifier Key Handling:
 * - Modifier keys (0xE0-0xE7) set bits in the modifier field
 * - Each modifier has its own bit position (Ctrl=0, Shift=1, Alt=2, GUI=3)
 * - Left and right variants use separate bits (e.g., Left Ctrl vs Right Ctrl)
 * 
 * Regular Key Handling:
 * - Regular keys stored in 6-element keycode array
 * - Function searches for empty slot (value 0)
 * - Duplicate keys ignored (prevents multiple entries for same key)
 * - Returns false if all 6 slots are full (keyboard rollover limit)
 * 
 * 6-Key Rollover Limitation:
 * - USB HID boot protocol supports maximum 6 simultaneous keys
 * - 7th key press will be ignored (function returns false)
 * - Could implement NKRO (N-key rollover) with custom report descriptor
 * 
 * @param key The HID keycode to add (modifier or regular key)
 * @return true if key was added, false if already present or buffer full
 * 
 * @note This function is called from main task context only
 * @note Modifier check uses IS_MOD() macro (checks range 0xE0-0xE7)

 * Modifier Key Handling:
 * - Clears the corresponding bit in the modifier field
 * - Uses bitwise AND with inverted mask to clear specific bit
 * - Only clears if bit was set (returns false if already clear)
 * 
 * Regular Key Handling:
 * - Searches keycode array for matching key
 * - Sets matching entry to 0 (marks slot as empty)
 * - Subsequent keys can use freed slots
 * 
 * Report Optimization:
 * - Only returns true if report actually changed
 * - Prevents unnecessary USB HID report transmission

/**
 * @brief Process keyboard input and generate USB HID report
 * 
 * Converts protocol-specific interface codes to USB HID keycodes via keyboard layout mapping,
 * then generates and transmits HID keyboard reports.
 * 
 * Data Flow:
 * 1. Receives interface code (protocol-normalized scancode, e.g., 0x48 for Pause)
 * 2. Translates to HID code via keymap_get_key_val() (keyboard layout mapping)
 * 3. Updates keyboard_report structure (modifiers, keys array)
 * 4. Processes command mode logic (bootloader entry detection)
 * 5. Transmits report via USB if modified
 * 
 * Debug Logging (Issue #21 - Temporary):
 * - Logs before/after keymap translation: interface code â†’ HID code
 * - Logs final HID report contents with [ISSUE-21-DEBUG] prefix
 * - Includes millisecond timestamps for timing analysis
 * - Will be removed before PR to main branch
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 * - Called from main task context only (via process_scancode())
 * - No interrupt access to keyboard_report structure
 * - Ring buffer provides thread-safe boundary from IRQ handlers
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Logs failed USB transmissions with report contents
 * - Continues operation on failure (transient USB issues)
 * - Could be enhanced with retry queue for critical reports
 * 
 * @param rawcode Interface scan code (protocol-normalized, not raw hardware scancode)
 *                Example: 0x48 for Pause key across all protocols
 * @param make    true for key press (make), false for key release (break)
 * 
 * @note Called from main task context via process_scancode()
 * @note Thread-safe: no interrupt access to keyboard_report or mouse_report
 * @note Debug logging will be removed before merge to main (Issue #21 investigation only)
