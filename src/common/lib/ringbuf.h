/**
 * @brief Ring buffer for interrupt-safe scancode queueing.
 * 
 * This ring buffer implementation provides lock-free communication between
 * IRQ context (producer) and main loop (consumer) for keyboard scancode buffering.
 * 
 * Buffer Sizing:
 * - Capacity: 32 bytes (31 usable due to full/empty distinction)
 * - Sized for worst-case burst scenarios and fast typing
 * 
 * Thread Safety Model:
 * - Producer (IRQ): Writes to head pointer, reads tail pointer
 * - Consumer (main): Writes to tail pointer, reads head pointer
 * - Volatile qualifiers ensure visibility across contexts
 * - Memory barriers (DMB) provide explicit synchronization guarantees
 * - No locks needed due to single-producer/single-consumer design
 * 
 * Performance Optimizations:
 * - Inline functions for zero-overhead abstraction
 * - Power-of-2 size enables fast masking (AND) instead of modulo
 * - Caller-checked guards eliminate redundant conditional branches
 * - Direct uint8_t return (no int16_t conversion overhead)
 * - Memory barriers ensure correctness with minimal overhead (+1 cycle)
 * 
 * Overflow Handling:
 * - Defensive check in ringbuf_put() logs error if called when full
 * - Simple logging - no counters or statistics tracking
 * - Data discarded when buffer full (IRQ cannot block)
 * 
 * Usage Pattern:
 * ```c
 * // Producer (IRQ context):
 * if (!ringbuf_is_full()) ringbuf_put(scancode);
 * 
 * // Consumer (main loop):
 * if (!ringbuf_is_empty()) {
 *     uint8_t scancode = ringbuf_get();
 *     process_scancode(scancode);
 * }
 * ```
