 * @file uart.c
 * @brief High-Performance DMA-Based UART Logging Implementation
 * 
 * This file implements a non-blocking, DMA-driven UART logging system designed
 * to provide high-performance debug output without interfering with real-time
 * operations such as keyboard protocol timing or USB HID communication.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Non-blocking operation: Logging never blocks the calling thread
 * - DMA-driven transmission: Minimal CPU overhead during output
 * - Large circular buffer queue: Handles initialization bursts without message loss
 * - stdio integration: Works with printf(), puts(), and other standard functions
 * - Adaptive behavior: Short waits during bursts, immediate drops under sustained load
 * - Low priority: Designed to not interfere with PIO state machines
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * The system uses a dual-path approach with a circular buffer queue:
 * 
 * 1. **Raw Write Path**: Used by stdio integration (printf, puts, etc.)
 *    - Bypasses vsnprintf() formatting overhead for pre-formatted strings
 *    - Direct memcpy() to queue buffers for maximum efficiency
 *    - Optimal for standard C library output functions
 * 
 * 2. **Formatted Write Path**: Used by direct uart_dma_printf() calls
 *    - Full vsnprintf() formatting for complex printf-style operations
 *    - Used when caller needs printf formatting capabilities
 * 
 * Both paths feed into the same DMA transmission system. When a message is
 * queued, if the DMA controller is idle, transmission begins immediately.
 * The DMA interrupt handler automatically starts subsequent queued messages,
 * providing continuous transmission without CPU intervention.
 * 
 * Performance Optimizations:
 * - Dual-path architecture: Raw writes bypass formatting overhead
 * - Queue size: 64 entries (power of 2) for handling initialization bursts
 * - Buffer alignment: 4-byte aligned for optimal DMA performance
 * - Bitwise operations: Uses AND instead of modulo for index calculations
 * - Separated producer/consumer: Clean queue management with atomic updates
 * - Low priority: DMA and IRQ configured to not interfere with timing-critical code
 * - Lock-free design: Relies on RP2040's natural atomicity for 8-bit operations
 * - Adaptive waiting: Short waits during bursts to prevent message loss
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 * The implementation is designed to be safely called from any context, including
 * interrupts, without the need for explicit locking. This is achieved through:
 * - Lock-free circular buffer design
 * - Atomic index updates (8-bit operations on RP2040)
 * - DMA hardware handling the actual transmission
 * 
 * Integration:
 * This UART implementation completely replaces the standard Pico SDK UART
 * stdio driver, providing a drop-in replacement that works with all standard
 * C library functions while offering superior performance characteristics:
 * 
 * - **stdio functions** (printf, puts, putchar, etc.): Use optimized raw write path
 * - **Direct calls** (uart_dma_printf): Use formatted write path when needed  
 * - **Transparent operation**: No code changes required for existing printf usage
 * - **Performance gains**: Significant improvement for stdio output via raw writes
 * - **Real-time safe**: Non-blocking operation prevents PIO timing interference

/**

 * 
 * This function provides a high-performance, non-blocking printf implementation
 * that queues formatted messages for DMA transmission. It represents the
 * "Formatted Write Path" in the dual-path architecture, handling full
 * printf-style formatting before queueing.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Standard vsnprintf() formatting with all printf capabilities
 * - Adaptive waiting (5ms) for queue space during bursts
 * - Input validation and automatic message truncation
 * - Immediate DMA initiation when controller is idle
 * - Graceful degradation under sustained load
 * 
 * Performance Path:
 * This is the "Formatted Write Path" for direct application calls that need
 * printf-style formatting. Unlike the raw write path used by stdio, this
 * path includes the full vsnprintf() formatting overhead but provides
 * complete printf compatibility.
 * 
 * Behavior:
 * - Waits up to 5ms for queue space (longer than stdio raw writes)
 * - Formats message using standard vsnprintf() with full printf support
 * - Validates formatting results and handles errors gracefully
 * - Truncates messages exceeding 256-byte buffer size
 * - Drops message if queue remains full after waiting period
 * - Atomically commits formatted message to queue
 * - Initiates DMA transfer if controller is idle
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 * - Safe to call from any context (main loop, interrupts, etc.)
 * - Uses atomic operations on RP2040 (8-bit index updates)
 * - No explicit locking required due to careful design
 * - Lock-free queue operations prevent blocking
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Formatting overhead: ~10-50Âµs (depends on format complexity)
 * - Queue operation: ~1-2Âµs (atomic index update)
 * - DMA setup: ~5-10Âµs (when starting new transfer)
 * - Total overhead: Usually <100Âµs for typical formatted messages
 * 
 * @param fmt Printf-style format string (supports all standard printf specifiers)
 * @param ... Variable arguments corresponding to format specifiers
 * 
 * @note Use standard printf() for most cases - it automatically uses raw write path
 * @note This function is for cases requiring direct DMA printf calls
 * @note Thread-safe: Can be called from any context including interrupts
 * 
 * @example
 * ```c
 * uart_dma_printf("Status: %s, Code: 0x%04X, Time: %lu\n", status, code, timestamp);
 * uart_dma_printf("Float value: %.2f\n", sensor_reading);
 * ```

 * 
 * This function performs complete system initialization for the high-performance

 * transparent, non-blocking debug output.
 * 
 * Initialization Sequence:
 * 1. **UART Hardware Setup**:
 *    - Initializes UART0 with configured baud rate (from config.h)
 *    - Configures GPIO pin for UART TX function
 *    - Sets up hardware FIFO and transmission parameters
 * 
 * 2. **DMA Channel Configuration**:
 *    - Claims unused DMA channel from hardware pool
 *    - Configures for 8-bit data transfers (character data)
 *    - Sets UART TX DREQ as transfer trigger signal
 *    - Points destination to UART hardware data register
 * 
 * 3. **Interrupt System Setup**:
 *    - Enables DMA completion interrupts for allocated channel
 *    - Registers dma_handler() as exclusive interrupt handler
 *    - Sets low priority (level 2) to avoid interfering with real-time code
 *    - Enables interrupt in NVIC for DMA_IRQ_0
 * 
 * 4. **stdio Integration**:
 *    - Registers DMA-based driver with Pico SDK stdio system
 *    - Replaces standard blocking UART stdio completely
 *    - Enables automatic CRLF conversion for proper line endings
 * 
 * Configuration Sources:
 * All configuration parameters are read from config.h:
 * - UART_BAUD: Transmission baud rate (typically 115200)
 * - UART_TX_PIN: GPIO pin number for UART TX (typically GP0)
 * 
 * Hardware Resources Used:
 * - UART0: Primary UART peripheral for transmission
 * - 1x DMA Channel: Automatically claimed from available pool  
 * - 1x GPIO Pin: Configured for UART TX function
 * - DMA_IRQ_0: Interrupt vector for DMA completion handling
 * 
 * Memory Resources:
 * - 64 x 256 bytes = 16KB: Message queue buffer (static allocation)
 * - ~100 bytes: Control structures and state variables
 * 
 * Post-Initialization Behavior:
 * After this function completes successfully:
 * - All printf(), puts(), putchar() calls use DMA automatically
 * - uart_dma_printf() is available for direct formatted calls
 * - System provides non-blocking, real-time safe debug output
 * - No code changes required for existing printf usage
 * 
 * @note **CRITICAL**: Must be called once during system initialization
 * @note **TIMING**: Call before any printf/logging operations
 * @note **SAFETY**: Safe to call multiple times (subsequent calls ignored)
 * @note **RESOURCES**: Claims hardware resources that remain allocated
 * @note **INTEGRATION**: Completely replaces standard Pico SDK UART stdio
 * 
 * @warning Calling printf() before this function results in no output
 * @warning Do not call from interrupt context during initialization
