 * Clears all buffered data by resetting head and tail pointers to zero.
 * This operation is NOT thread-safe and should only be called when:
 * - During initialization (before IRQ is enabled)
 * - When keyboard state machine enters reset/error state
 * - When IRQs are temporarily disabled
 * 
 * WARNING: Do not call this function while IRQ handlers may be active,
 * as it modifies both head and tail pointers without synchronization.
 * 
 * @note All buffered scancodes will be discarded
 * @note Does not modify the buffer contents, only the pointers
