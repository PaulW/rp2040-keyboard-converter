/**
 * @brief Gamma-Corrected Brightness Lookup Table
 * 
 * This lookup table provides perceptually linear brightness control for WS2812 LEDs
 * by applying gamma correction. Human perception of brightness is non-linear - doubling
 * the electrical brightness does not result in perceived doubling of light intensity.
 * 
 * Gamma Correction Theory:
 * - Human eye response follows a power curve (approximately γ = 2.2-2.8)
 * - Linear brightness steps (e.g., 25, 50, 75, 100) appear uneven to the eye
 * - Gamma correction compensates by using a power function: output = input^γ
 * - Result: Each brightness step appears perceptually uniform
 * 
 * Table Design:
 * - Input range: 1-10 (user-facing brightness levels)
 * - Output range: 0-255 (8-bit PWM duty cycle multiplier)
 * - Index 0 is unused (brightness levels start at 1, not 0)
 * - Calibrated for approximately γ = 2.5 power curve
 * - Values hand-tuned for smooth visual progression
 * 
 * Usage Pattern:
 * ```c
 * uint8_t user_brightness = 3;  // Range 1-10
 * uint8_t multiplier = BRIGHTNESS_LUT[user_brightness];  // → 10
 * uint8_t adjusted_red = (red_value * multiplier) / 255;
 * ```
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Lookup time: O(1) - single array access
 * - Memory: 11 bytes (const, stored in flash not RAM)
 * - Static linkage: Internal to this compilation unit only
 * - Zero computational overhead vs real-time gamma calculation
 * 
 * Brightness Curve Analysis:
 * | Level | Multiplier | % of Max | Perceived | Step Size |
 * |-------|------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
 * |   1   |     2      |   0.8%   |   ~10%    |    -      |
 * |   2   |     5      |   2.0%   |   ~20%    |  ~10%     |
 * |   3   |    10      |   3.9%   |   ~30%    |  ~10%     |
 * |   4   |    20      |   7.8%   |   ~40%    |  ~10%     |
 * |   5   |    35      |  13.7%   |   ~50%    |  ~10%     |
 * |   6   |    60      |  23.5%   |   ~60%    |  ~10%     |
 * |   7   |    90      |  35.3%   |   ~70%    |  ~10%     |
 * |   8   |   135      |  52.9%   |   ~80%    |  ~10%     |
 * |   9   |   190      |  74.5%   |   ~90%    |  ~10%     |
 * |  10   |   255      | 100.0%   |  ~100%    |  ~10%     |
 * 
 * Alternative Approaches (Not Used):
 * - Real-time calculation: `pow(input/10.0, 2.5) * 255` - Too slow (uses float/libm)
 * - Linear scaling: `input * 25.5` - Perceptually uneven, fails at low brightness
 * - Larger LUT: More granularity - Unnecessary for 10-level user control
 * 
 * Calibration Notes:
 * - Low end (1-3): Critical for dim ambient lighting, careful logarithmic spacing
 * - Mid range (4-7): Balanced progression for typical indoor use
 * - High end (8-10): Aggressive scaling to reach full brightness smoothly
 * - Level 1 intentionally dim (0.8%) for night use / dark environments
 * - Level 10 = 255 ensures full LED capability is accessible
 * 
 * @note Array is 0-indexed but brightness levels are 1-indexed (1-10)
 * @note Index 0 contains 0 (unused) - attempting brightness=0 yields black
 * @note Static storage in flash (const) - no RAM consumption
 * @note Compiler may optimize away unused table entries if brightness is compile-time constant

/**
 * @brief Applies gamma-corrected brightness and color order to LED color value
 * 
 * This function performs two critical transformations on the input RGB color:
 * 
 * 1. **Gamma-Corrected Brightness Scaling**:
 *    - Looks up perceptually-linear multiplier from BRIGHTNESS_LUT
 *    - Scales each RGB component: `output = (input * multiplier) / 255`
 *    - Division by 255 normalizes the result back to 8-bit range (0-255)
 *    - Uses integer arithmetic for performance (no floating point)
 * 
 * 2. **Color Order Conversion**:
 *    - Different WS2812-compatible LEDs use different color orders
 *    - Common variants: RGB, GRB (most common), BGR, RBG, GBR, BRG
 *    - Function reorders color bytes based on CONVERTER_LEDS_TYPE configuration
 *    - Ensures correct color output regardless of LED chip variant
 * 
 * Performance Optimizations:
 * - Function is `static inline` for potential inlining at call site
 * - Brightness multiplier lookup is O(1) array access (not calculated)
 * - Color extraction uses bit shifts and masks (fast bitwise ops)
 * - Integer-only arithmetic (no floating point or division hardware needed)
 * - Switch statement may be optimized to jump table by compiler
 * - Conditional compilation (#ifdef) eliminates unused code paths
 * 
 * Mathematical Details:
 * ```
 * Brightness scaling formula:
 *   output_component = (input_component × multiplier) ÷ 255
 * 
 * Example (brightness level 3, multiplier = 10):
 *   input_red = 255 (full intensity)
 *   output_red = (255 × 10) ÷ 255 = 2550 ÷ 255 = 10
 *   
 * Example (brightness level 10, multiplier = 255):
 *   input_red = 128 (half intensity)
 *   output_red = (128 × 255) ÷ 255 = 128 (unchanged)
 * ```
 * 
 * Why Division by 255 (Not 256):
 * - Multiplier is in range [0, 255] representing fraction of brightness
 * - Division by 255 gives exact scaling: multiplier 255 = 100%, multiplier 128 = ~50.2%
 * - Division by 256 would give: multiplier 255 = 99.6%, multiplier 128 = 50.0%
 * - Using 255 ensures multiplier=255 doesn't dim the LED by 0.4%
 * - Compiler may optimize `/255` to `(x * 0x8080 + 0x8000) >> 23` or similar
 * 
 * Color Order Examples:
 * ```
 * Input:  0x00FF8040 (R=255, G=128, B=64)
 * 
 * LED_RGB: 0x00FF8040 → [R][G][B] → Red=255, Green=128, Blue=64
 * LED_GRB: 0x0080FF40 → [G][R][B] → Green=255, Red=128, Blue=64 (most common)
 * LED_BGR: 0x004080FF → [B][G][R] → Blue=255, Green=128, Red=64
 * ```
 * 
 * Byte Order in Memory (Little-Endian RP2040):
 * ```
 * 32-bit value 0x00RRGGBB in memory:
 *   [BB] [GG] [RR] [00]  ← Lowest address
 *   byte0 byte1 byte2 byte3
 * 
 * PIO shifts out MSB first, so byte order sent to LED:
 *   [00] [RR] [GG] [BB]  ← Bit 31 first, bit 0 last
 * ```
 * 
 * Typical Call Flow:
 * ```
 * User calls: ws2812_show(0x00FF0000)  // Red in RGB format
 *             ↓
 * ws2812_set_color(0x00FF0000)
 *   → Extracts: R=255, G=0, B=0
 *   → Applies brightness (e.g., level 3): R=10, G=0, B=0
 *   → Reorders for GRB: returns 0x000A0000 (G=0, R=10, B=0)
 *             ↓
 * Value shifted left 8 bits: 0x00A00000
 *   → PIO autopull converts to GRB bit stream
 *   → LED displays dim red (gamma-corrected)
 * ```
 * 
 * @param led_color Input color in RGB format (0x00RRGGBB)
 * @return Color value converted to LED's color order with brightness applied
 * 
 * @note Input is always RGB format (user-facing)
 * @note Output format depends on CONVERTER_LEDS_TYPE configuration
 * @note Brightness is applied before color reordering
 * @note Function is static inline for performance
 * @note All calculations use integer arithmetic (fast on Cortex-M0+)
