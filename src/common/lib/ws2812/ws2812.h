/**
 * @brief Update WS2812 LED with the specified color (non-blocking)
 * 
 * Queues a color update to a WS2812 LED via the PIO state machine. This is a
 * non-blocking operation that checks the PIO TX FIFO before writing. If the
 * FIFO is full, the function returns false immediately without blocking.
 * 
 * Color Format:
 * - 24-bit RGB color value (0x00RRGGBB format)
 * - Automatically converted to WS2812 GRB format
 * - Brightness adjustment applied based on configuration
 * 
 * Non-Blocking Behavior:
 * - Returns true if color data was successfully queued to PIO FIFO
 * - Returns false if PIO TX FIFO is full (caller should defer and retry)
 * - Returns false if called before ws2812_setup() (uninitialized)
 * - Never blocks waiting for FIFO space
 * 
 * Multi-LED Cascading:
 * - Call once per LED in the chain
 * - First call updates first LED, second call updates second LED, etc.
 * - After all LEDs updated, a ≥50µs reset pulse latches colors simultaneously
 * 
 * @param led_color RGB color value in 0x00RRGGBB format
 * @return true if update was queued successfully, false if deferred (retry later)
 * 
 * @note Fully non-blocking - safe to call from any context
 * @note Caller must handle false return by deferring update
 * @note Call sites in led_helper.c implement proper deferral logic
