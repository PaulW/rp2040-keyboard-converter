# Scancode Set Name

Brief introduction (2-3 sentences) explaining what this scancode set is, which keyboards/protocols use it, and when it was introduced. Write conversationally.

Explain the key characteristics that make this scancode set different from others (encoding scheme, multi-byte sequences, special features).

---

## Encoding Scheme

### Basic Encoding

Explain how make codes and break codes are encoded. Include:
- Make code format
- Break code format
- Any prefix bytes or special sequences
- Bit ordering (LSB-first/MSB-first if relevant)

### Make and Break Codes

| Event | Encoding | Example (A key = 0xXX) |
|-------|----------|------------------------|
| **Key Press (Make)** | Format | `XX` |
| **Key Release (Break)** | Format | `XX XX` |

Explain the encoding scheme and why it works this way.

### Extended Keys (if applicable)

If this scancode set uses prefix bytes for extended keys (like E0 in Set 2/3, or E1 for special sequences):

| Event | Encoding | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Extended Make** | Format | `E0 XX` |
| **Extended Break** | Format | `E0 XX XX` |

List extended keys:
- Right Alt, Right Ctrl
- Arrow keys, navigation keys
- Keypad keys
- Windows/GUI keys

### Special Sequences

Document any unusual multi-byte sequences (Pause/Break, Print Screen, etc.):

| Key | Sequence | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Pause** | Full sequence | Explain quirks |
| **Print Screen** | Full sequence | Explain fake shifts if applicable |

---

## State Machine

Describe the state machine complexity for this scancode set. Include:
- Number of states required
- State transition diagram (ASCII art)
- How multi-byte sequences are processed

```
┌─────────────┐
│    IDLE     │◄──────── Initial state
└──────┬──────┘
       │
   (diagram showing state transitions)
```

Explain what each state represents and when transitions occur.

## Scancode Tables

### Main Keyboard

Complete scancode table for alphanumeric and modifier keys:

| Scancode | Key | Make | Break | Notes |
|----------|-----|------|-------|-------|
| 0xXX | Esc | `XX` | `XX XX` | |
| 0xXX | F1 | `XX` | `XX XX` | |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Organise logically (by keyboard rows, or by scancode value—whichever makes more sense).

### Extended Keys (if applicable)

Table for extended scancode sequences:

| Scancode | Key | Make | Break | Notes |
|----------|-----|------|-------|-------|
| 0xXX | Right Alt | `E0 XX` | `E0 XX XX` | AltGr on ISO layouts |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Function Keys

Separate section if function keys use different encoding or extended sequences.

### Navigation Cluster

Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up, Page Down, Arrow Keys

### Keypad

Include separate number pad scancodes. Note whether Num Lock affects scancodes or just interpretation.

---

## Special Keys

### Pause/Break

Detailed explanation of Pause/Break key behaviour, including:
- Full sequence breakdown
- Why it's unusual
- Variants (different keyboards may implement differently)
- How to handle in state machine

### Print Screen

Explain Print Screen sequences, including:
- Fake shift codes (if applicable)
- Why fake shifts exist
- How to filter them correctly

### Other Special Keys (if applicable)

Document any other keys with unusual behaviour:
- Power/Sleep/Wake keys
- Multimedia keys
- Application keys

---

## Implementation Notes

### Scancode Processor

Explain how this scancode set is implemented in the converter:

- **[`scancode_processor.h`](../../src/scancodes/setname/scancode_processor.h)** - State machine and definitions
- **[`scancode_processor.c`](../../src/scancodes/setname/scancode_processor.c)** - Implementation

### State Machine Implementation

Describe key aspects of the implementation:
- How multi-byte sequences are buffered
- State transition logic
- Edge cases and error handling

### Translation to HID

Explain how scancodes map to USB HID keycodes:
- Direct mappings
- Special handling for certain keys
- Modifier key encoding

Include code snippets if helpful for understanding, but keep them high-level.

## Usage

### Which Keyboards Use This Set?

List keyboards/protocols that use this scancode set:
- Keyboard Model 1
- Keyboard Model 2
- etc.

### Building with This Scancode Set

If keyboards auto-detect or manually specify the scancode set in configuration:

```bash
# Example build command (if relevant)
docker compose run --rm -e KEYBOARD="keyboard-using-this-set" builder
```
