# Protocol Name

Brief introduction paragraph (1-3 sentences) explaining what this protocol is, when it was used, and its key characteristics. Write conversationally—this sets the tone for the document.

---

## Historical Context

Explain the protocol's origins and evolution. Include:
- When and why it was introduced
- Which systems/keyboards used it
- How it evolved or what replaced it
- Any interesting historical notes or variants

Keep it conversational and personal where appropriate. Example: "When IBM released the PC/AT in August 1984, they completely redesigned..."

## Protocol Overview

### Key Characteristics

High-level summary of what makes this protocol work:
- **Direction**: Unidirectional/Bidirectional/Poll-based
- **Timing**: Self-clocked/Host-clocked/etc.
- **Error Detection**: Parity/Handshake/None
- **Special Features**: Any unique characteristics

Explain these in natural language, not just bullet points. Help the reader understand WHY these design choices matter.

---

## Physical Interface

### Connectors and Pinouts

Include pinout diagrams and connector images where relevant:

![Connector Pinout](../images/connectors/connector_name.png)

**Pinout** (describe orientation):
- Pin 1: Signal name - Description
- Pin 2: Signal name - Description
- etc.

Explain any connector variants or compatibility issues between different models.

---

## Communication Protocol

Detailed technical specifications for how data is transmitted:

### Frame Structure
- Bit order (LSB-first/MSB-first)
- Frame format (start bits, data bits, parity, stop bits)
- Timing specifications (actual values from official documentation)

### Timing Diagrams

Include ASCII timing diagrams where helpful. Example:
```
CLOCK:  ‾‾‾\___/‾‾‾\___/‾‾‾
DATA: ____/‾‾‾\___/‾‾‾\__
      ^    ^    ^    ^
      Start D0   D1   D2
```

### Protocol States

Explain the state machine or communication flow with practical examples.

---

## Protocol-Specific Sections

**This section varies by protocol.** Include sections specific to your protocol:

### For Bidirectional Protocols:
- Host Commands
- Device Responses  
- LED Control
- etc.

### For Unidirectional Protocols:
- Scan Code Set
- Protocol Operation
- etc.

### For Poll-Based Protocols:
- Commands and Responses
- Keyboard Operation
- etc.

Keep explanations conversational and practical.

## Implementation Notes

### Overview

Brief paragraph explaining the implementation approach for this converter. Example: "This implementation handles the protocol almost entirely in hardware using the RP2040's PIO..."

### Key Implementation Files

- **[`protocol.pio`](../../src/protocols/name/protocol.pio)**: PIO assembly for timing
- **[`keyboard_interface.h`](../../src/protocols/name/keyboard_interface.h)**: Protocol constants
- **[`keyboard_interface.c`](../../src/protocols/name/keyboard_interface.c)**: State machine and event processing

### Implementation Details

Explain key aspects of how the protocol is implemented:
- PIO timing calculations
- State machine logic
- Any special handling or edge cases

Use code snippets where helpful, but keep explanations clear and high-level.

## Troubleshooting

Brief conversational intro paragraph. Example: "If you're running into issues with your [protocol] keyboard, the problems usually fall into a few common categories. For general hardware setup issues, have a look at the **[Hardware Setup Guide](../getting-started/hardware-setup.md)**."

**Basic voltage checks with a multimeter:**
- VCC: Expected voltage ±tolerance
- GND: 0V
- Idle signals: Expected levels

### Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | What to Check |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Observable problem | Most common reason | Practical steps to verify |
| Another problem | Another reason | More practical steps |
| etc. | etc. | etc. |

Keep the table focused on protocol-specific issues, not general hardware problems.
