| **Make** | Manufacturer name |
| **Model** | Full model designation |
| **Keys** | Number of keys (e.g., 101 ANSI / 102 ISO) |
| **Protocol** | Protocol used (AT/PS2, XT, Amiga, M0110) |
| **Codeset** | Scancode set (Set 1, Set 2, Set 3, Set123, Amiga) |
| **Connector** | Physical connector type and pinout |
| **Voltage** | Operating voltage |
| **Switch Type** | Switch technology (buckling spring, membrane, etc.) |
| **Key Rollover** | Rollover capability (2KRO, NKRO, etc.) |

Add or remove rows as appropriate for your keyboard. These are the specifications to document.

## Features

Describe the keyboard's notable features in conversational prose. Include:
- Switch feel and sound characteristics
- Build quality and materials (case, keycaps, backplate)
- Layout variations (ANSI/ISO, language variants)
- LED indicators (if any)
- Cable type (fixed/removable)
- Any quirks or interesting design choices

### Key Rollover

If relevant, explain the keyboard's key rollover behaviour. For membrane-based keyboards, mention 2KRO limitations. For capacitive keyboards, note NKRO support. Explain what this means for practical use.

If there are matrix quirks (certain key combinations that work or don't work due to wiring), mention those here.

### Special Features Section (if applicable)

If your keyboard has unique features (programmable keys, special function layers, unusual modifiers), create additional subsections here to explain them.

## Building Firmware

Build firmware specifically for this keyboard:

```bash
# Keyboard only
docker compose run --rm -e KEYBOARD="brand/model" builder

# Keyboard + Mouse (if protocol supports mouse)
docker compose run --rm -e KEYBOARD="brand/model" -e MOUSE="protocol" builder
```

**Output**: `build/rp2040-converter.uf2`

See: [Building Firmware Guide](../../getting-started/building-firmware.md)

## Key Mapping

The default keymap matches the original keyboard layout. Describe any custom modifications or non-standard mappings.

### Base Layer Mapping

Include ASCII art diagram showing the physical layout and key mappings. Use the format:

```
Keyboard Model Name

...etc...
```
